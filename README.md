# Portfolio: testing engineer
## About me
>Hi! My name is Olga. I am a novice tester. In this repository you can get acquainted with my achievements during the training plans.

>I fully understand the basics of testing theory, and I also understand the software development process. I am able to work effectively with a large amount of new information and quickly master new concepts and technologies.

I have experience working with Jira and Confluence, and I can effectively use these tools to organize and manage test tasks and documentation. My knowledge of SQL at the level of writing simple queries allows me to test databases.

I also have experience testing the API using Postman. I confidently use this tool to test the functionality and reliability of the API.

I would like to emphasize that I have communication skills that allow me to collaborate with team members. I am ready to work both independently and in a team to achieve common goals and ensure high quality software development.
