# Portfolio: testing engineer
## About me
My name is Olga. I am a novice tester and I want to develop in this field.

In 2009, she graduated from the Institute of International Trade and Law with a degree in Finance and Credit.

At the moment, I am studying at the largest online school in Russia, Skyeng (SkyPro direction), where I get practical testing experience. 

I know functional, non-functional testing, how to properly compile test documentation, and I am excellent at applying test design techniques. 

I own Postman, Jira, Confluence, MySQL, Qase.io and some other programs. I have a certificate in HTML and CSS.

In the future, I plan to master Selenium.

Among the cases that I solved were the following: functional, regression testing, testing of the Skypro API platform for teachers. Also testing the online store's shopping cart https://shop.mts.ru . Functional testing was performed, API testing was performed, SQL queries were executed.

My previous work experience was associated with the company “Bohemia" LLC. 
In the ”Bohemian" she held the position of a bartender, whose duties included serving visitors, maintaining primary documentation, working with suppliers, carrying out organizational work for various events. 
The work required an active lifestyle, extensive knowledge of information, and active communication with both visitors and suppliers. 

I would also like to note that I have such personal qualities as perseverance, attention to detail, learning ability, and an analytical mindset.
